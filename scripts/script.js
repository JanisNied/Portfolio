        description: '<img src="media/images/previewthingy.png" style="width:30%;height:30%;float:left;margin:1rem;border-radius:0.5rem">This was my first attempt at trying out a completely new game engine - the Godot Engine. Its language was very intuitive, basically just Python catered to game developers. I was very experimental with this one, attempting to seamlessly integrate both 3D and 2D scenes into a single cohesive game (which could\'ve turned out better if me and my teammates had a more systematic style). I was responsible for creating the points handling system, attempting to interconnect each minigame, so that regardless of how the code was written, it could be applied to my own codebase in a simple and quick manner. While it\'s still a mess, I believe that this was a great project to work on. Learned quite a few things during that journey, mostly about Godot and how thought out the engine was. I still preferred to work on the Unity engine, but this was a unique experience.<br><br>My team ended up getting 1st place. Though we were mostly carried by our vast knowledge of programming fields in the 2nd stage of this "gamejam".<br><br>This event was organized by the lovely people at <a style="color:#b833ff !important;--givenColor: #b833ff;" href="https://www.digip.lv/olimpiade-2024#olimpiade-about" target="_blank">Digit캐lo Inov캐ciju Parks</a>, thanks for hosting! :D<br><br>Project is available here: <a href="https://github.com/JanisNied/LiepajaDzimsanasTorte" target="_blank" style="color:#658ce6 !important;--givenColor: #658ce6;">(Link)</a>',

This mod is the result of that.<br><br><img src="media/images/nullworkscreenshot1.png" style="width:30%;height:30%;float:right;margin:1rem;border-radius:0.5rem">Nullwork is a recreation of a game with the same name, that was originally developed for Roblox <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/4486383608/Nullwork" target="_blank" style="color:#658ce6 !important;--givenColor: #658ce6;">(Link)</a> - now brought to Unity and the VR space. My goal with this project was to step out of my comfort zone - specifically doing programming the normal way, because Bonelab has an unusual way of modding. Majority of actions have to be handled using events, specifically the <a href="https://kybernetik.com.au/ultevents/" target="_blank" style="color:#e5e835 !important;--givenColor: #e5e835;">UltEvents</a> package. It\'s almost as powerful as code, but requires quite the problem solving skills.<br><br>Currently though, this mod is broken due to Bonelab\'s recent updates to both the game and SDK. This leaves the mod in an unplayable state, hence why it\'s currently private to deter anyone from asking for updates (for my own sake).

The hardest thing for me was figuring out a way to have the page interact with the JS code, since React does it a bit differently. PHP wasn\'t that much of a burden though, as a matter of fact it was quite simple when I got the hang of it.

I thought almost about every feature that was included - authentication, pizza selection and creation, orders and others. This one was a bit of a doozy, lost motivation here and there, but pulled through eventually. (Yeah, I finished the project overnight, don\'t blame me - it\'s genuinely <i>massive</i>.)<br><br>Speaking of authentication, I started using databases in this project. SQLite specfically, since it was the obvious choice for a quick and lightweight database. I didn\'t know what I was doing, but it still works - though looks like a mess, since I didn\'t know databases that much in my second year.<img src="media/images/pizzapreview.png" style="width:30%;height:30%;float:right;margin:1rem;border-radius:0.5rem"><br><br>My biggest achievement was figuring out how to make the address selection work. I was inspired by this same assignment, but from a person that was a year ahead. They had a similar system, though you couldn\'t click on the map to select your own address and had to write it manually (It was very prone to errors). I stepped it up a notch and did just that. I\'m shocked I even managed that.<br><br>Project available here: <a href="https://github.com/JanisNied/PizzaDeliveryApp" target="_blank" style="color:#658ce6 !important;--givenColor: #658ce6;">(Link)</a>',

I may have overcomplicated things slightly in the code, but it\'s certainly functional right now at least. I like the UI as well. I tried to mimick the original source and match it as closely while keeping the feel that I wanted for this project. Lore descriptions for both character types were written by a very special person to me - shoutout to them! This project also incorporates several paid assets (not included in the repo, but included in a compiled variant in the releases tab) which make this "game" look slightly better.<br><br>Project available here: <a href="https://github.com/JanisNied/Customiser" target="_blank" style="color:#658ce6 !important;--givenColor: #658ce6;">(Link)</a>',
