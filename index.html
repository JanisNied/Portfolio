                            <h3>A bit about myself:</h3>
                            <p>I'm an aspiring 3rd year student at a technical school in Latvia</p>
                            <p>I speak 3 languages fluently: Latvian, English and Russian</p>
                            <p>I'm mostly trying to focus on game development as a hobby, since I really enjoy the intricacies of game design and challenging myself to new heights</p>
                             <p>I still have quite a bit of hands-on experience with web development (Full-Stack) - mostly focusing on experimentation rather than large projects</p>
                            <p>Most of my work I've put into modding games, experimenting with Unity and attempting to make models and room concepts/designs with Unity Probuilder and Blender</p>
                            <br>
